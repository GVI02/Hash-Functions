# Hash Functions

## What is this?
Python implementation of various hash functions.\
SHA-1 according to RFC3174 -> [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3174](url)

## Why does it exist?
For how prevelent hash functions are in all aspects of Computer Science they always seem to be presented as a magical black box.
You put text in you get text out and you cant reverse the process. Thats what a large amount of explanations end at, so I wanted to delve a bit deeper and see how this thing works. If you, like me, have wondered how hash functions work, I hope this helps you on your journey.

## Should you use it?
Detail and ease of reading are priorities when making these programs and as such efficiency is most sertainly lacking in these implementations.
If use in projects is your goal there are a lot of other more efficient and thought out implementations of this algorithm I am sure you can find.
