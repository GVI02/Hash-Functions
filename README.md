# SHA-1

## What is this?
Python implementation of the SHA-1 algorithm according to RFC3174.

## Why does it exist?
For how prevelent hash functions are in all aspects of Computer Science they always seem to be presented as a magical black box.
You put text in you get text out and you cant reverse the process. Thats what a large amount of explanations end at, so I wanted to delve a bit deeper and see how this thing works. If you, like me, have wondered how hash functions work, I hope this helps you on your journey.

## Should you use it?
Aside from the fact that you shouldn't use SHA-1 in general if security is your intended result, there are alot of other more efficient and thought out implementations of this algorithm I am sure you can find.
